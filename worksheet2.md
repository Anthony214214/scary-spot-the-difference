# Scary Spot the Difference

In this resource you will make a Spot the Difference game with a difference! While the player is focused intently on the screen trying to figure out the difference between two images, they'll have no idea they're about to receive the fright of their lives.

## Gathering the assets

1. You're going to need two images and a sound file for this activity. Firstly, you'll need a Spot the Difference image. This one is free to use, but you can make or find your own if you prefer. Right click on the image and save it onto your computer.

2. Next, you'll need the image you're going to swap out to give them a fright. This zombie face is cool, but you can make or find your own if you like. Just remember the age of the people you're trying to scare and choose something appropriate.

3. Lastly, you'll need a scary sound to really give them a fright. You could use a sound from the Scratch library, or you could download [this one](http://soundbible.com/1627-Female-Scream-Horror.html), or perhaps if you have a microphone you can record your own scary sound! 

## Setting up your Scratch project



## What next?

Maybe you could make the game a little more realistic. Maybe the game could keep a fake score of differences spotted, before the scary face jumps out. Perhaps you could add a timer so your friend concentrates really hard trying to spot the differences before the time runs out?
