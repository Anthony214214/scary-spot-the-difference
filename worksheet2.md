# Scary Spot the Difference

In this resource you will make a Spot the Difference game with a difference! While the player is focused intently on the screen trying to figure out the difference between two images, they'll have no idea they're about to receive the fright of their lives.

## Gathering the assets

1. You're going to need two images and a sound file for this activity. Firstly, you'll need a Spot the Difference image. This one is free to use, but you can make or find your own if you prefer. 

If you would like to use this image, right click on the image and save it onto your computer.

2. Next, you'll need the image you're going to swap out to give them a fright. This zombie face is cool, but you can make or find your own if you like. Just remember the age of the people you're trying to scare and choose something appropriate.

3. Lastly, you'll need a scary sound to really give them a fright. You could use a sound from the Scratch library, you could download [this scream sound](http://soundbible.com/1627-Female-Scream-Horror.html), or perhaps if you have a microphone you could record your own scary sound! 

## Setting up your Scratch project

1. [Open up a new project](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-new) in Scratch

2. Delete the cat sprite by right clicking on it, and then clicking 'delete'

3. Now click on the 'Backdrops' tab, and then click on the folder icon to upload a backdrop from file

4. Select your scary face picture and click "Open"

5. If your scary picture doesn't fill up the whole stage, use the select tool to draw a box around it and then use the handles on the box to make it larger

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for your spot the difference picture

## Instructions for the player

1. You want your player to be fooled into thinking this is a real spot the difference game, so let's give them some instructions! Click on the blank backdrop (backdrop1) to select it, and click on the text tool.

2. With the text tool selected, click on the blank backdrop where you would like to write your fake "spot the difference" instructions - tee hee!

5. Draw backdrop one - instructions and button

6. Program button so that when they click it displays spot the diff and then waits x seconds (rand?)

7. Then scary face appears

## What next?

Maybe you could make the game a little more realistic. Maybe the game could keep a fake score of differences spotted, before the scary face jumps out. Perhaps you could add a timer so your friend concentrates really hard trying to spot the differences before the time runs out?
