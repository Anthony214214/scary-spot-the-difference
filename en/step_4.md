## Gathering the assets

- You're going to need two images and a sound file for this activity. Firstly, you'll need a Spot the Difference image. This one is free to use, but you can make or find your own if you prefer.

- Next, you'll need the image you're going to swap out to give them a fright. This zombie face is cool, but you can make or find your own if you like. Just remember the age of the people you're trying to scare and choose something appropriate.

- Lastly, you'll need a scary sound to really give them a fright. You can download [this one](http://soundbible.com/1627-Female-Scream-Horror.html), which should do the trick. Make sure you download the `wav` version of the file, or again find your own. Once you have the file, rename it to `scream.wav`.

- Save all the files in a single directory, where your Python script will be.
