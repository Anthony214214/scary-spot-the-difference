## Challenge: take it further

Can you make the game more realistic?

+ Have a look at the [Pygame website](http://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/newbieguide.html) to find out how to detect mouse clicks from your victim so they can click on differences. 

+ Make the game keep a fake score of differences spotted before the scary face appears.
