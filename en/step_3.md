## Scary Spot the Difference - Python

In this resource you will make a Spot the Difference game with a difference! While the player is focused intently on the screen trying to figure out the difference between two images, they'll have no idea they're about to receive the fright of their life.

If you would like to make this project using Scratch instead of Python, head over to the [Scratch worksheet](worksheet2.md).
